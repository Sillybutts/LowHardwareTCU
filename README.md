## Description

This is the Low Hardware TCU, a blaster with barely any non-printed parts. It uses no screws, no metal pins, barely anything that isn't printed. The only non-printed parts are

- 2 rubber bands
- k25 or 788 main spring
- 1x 012 o-ring
- 2x -123 o-rings

The plunger tube is a fully printed design that fits in standard TCs, Caliburns, and Lynxes without modification to the blaster. Just lengthen the plunger tube in CAD to fit the length of your blaster. Use more lubrication in the plunger tube than you normally would.

The barrel is a fully printed design, with a SCAR. The ramrod is fully printed in a sturdy and strong way. The U channels are all printed. Everything is held together by interlocking parts, dovetails, and some friction. 

The blaster hits 160 avg with k25. Below a normal TCU, but still impressive for a blaster like this. The blaster can take Talon and Katana magazines. 


All STLs were exported in print orientation. The F3D source file is also provided.
